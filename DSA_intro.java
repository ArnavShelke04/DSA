// data structure is the arrangement of data so that it can be used more efficiently
// // database is collection of data for faster retrieval , basically harddisk main jo data hai usko renew karna aur retrieve karna and yeh data memory main nahi aata, kyuki harddrive wala data safe hota hai and RAM which is main memory iska data after shutting the program delete ho jata hai
// datawarehouse: ab kuch data with time poorana ho jata hai jisko hum apne main data ke saath nahi rakhna chahte , this data is legacy data and iss data ko hum data warehouse main rakhte hai.par yeh data useless bhi nahi hai as this old data can be used for analysis
// BIG Data: kuch database bohot bade hote hai and normal algorithms cannot handle it thus iski study BIG Data main aati hai
// Stack:normal memory jisme normal variables ki memory store hoti ya fir functions ki memory store nahi hoti
// for memory allocation of methods watch video1 of the course from 21:00 ---- seems imp
//  Heap: we request memory from the heap using a pointer in c and c++ but for java primitive datatypes like int and float are stored in stack but
//memory for objects is automatically used from the heap. Ye memory ka advantage hai ki we can use and release the memory whenever we want but for stack memory , it stays until the function is executed
