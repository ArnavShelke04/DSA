// imagine i have a friend who lives 5 km away from me and he has some game and i wanna play that game and we both have less internet .
// now if the game is 250kb i wont physically visit him with a harddrive for that game ill just ask him to upload the game to some drive or shit(ALGORITHM 1)
// but if the game is 60 GB ill have to visit him with my bike and harddisk to get that game(ALGORITHM 2)
// Now algo 1 is time dependent as it will take more time for the game to upload if the game size is more
// but algo2 ke liye size dependancy nahi hai(neglect time for copying) upload time par. 
// how the time required depends on input size --this analysis is called time Time_Complexity
// if we were to write an equation for time (t) with input(n) in this case we will write t=An^0 + B (A and B are random constants,n^0 because algo2 is n independent) , we can say that this algo hai big O of n^0 or O(n^0)=O(1) and we thus explain timecomplexity with help of big o notations
